\textbf{Example 1} : computation of the LO Wilson Coefficients at $\mu=4 \gev$ using $\Lambda^4 = 0.325 \gev$ 
and $\as$ in LO. Note that to obtain the Wilson Coefficients in the LO approximation 
we must use the one-loop running of $\as$, while for the NLO approximation the two-loop running.\\

Since we want to start from the $\Lambda$ parameter in the 4-flavor theory we have to first 
find the $\Lambda$ parameter in the 5-flavor theory where we match the standard model with 
effective weak hamiltonian. Hence we start by computing $\as$ at the bottom threshold\\
\code{amb = alphas[mbottom,0.325,3,4,1];}\\
and then we compute $\Lambda^5$ by matching the 4 and 5 flavors theories\\
\code{L = FindLambda[amb,mbottom,3,5,1];}\\
\code{aMW = alphas[mMW,L,3,5,1];}\\

Now we can evolve the Wilson Coefficients down to $4 \gev$\\
\code{z = ComputeZ[4,aMW,1,MW];}\\
\code{y = ComputeY[z,4,aMW,1,MW];}\\

To obtain the LO results we simply use\\
\code{ReduceOrder[z,"LO"]}\\
\code{ReduceOrder[y,"LO"]}\\

\textbf{Example 2}: computation of the NLO Wilson Coefficients at $\mu=1 \gev$ using $\as(\mz)$\\
\code{z = ComputeZ[4,alphasMZ,2];}\\
\code{y = ComputeY[z,4,alphasMZ,2];}\\

To obtain the NLO results we simply use\\
\code{ReduceOrder[z,"NLO"]}\\
\code{ReduceOrder[y,"NLO"]}
